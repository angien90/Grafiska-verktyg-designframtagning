# üê∏ Welcome to the World of Poison Dart Frogs 
Welcome to our website about poison dart frogs! Here, you‚Äôll get a glimpse into the colorful world of these small yet fascinating creatures. The site features both fun and interactive elements, such as a game where you can search for a hidden frog in the rainforest, as well as fun facts about poison dart frogs. Explore and learn more about these incredible animals in a fun and engaging way!


## üîç Project overview
This project is part of a school assignment where we developed a website about poison dart frogs based on a design created by another group (The Poison Dart Frogs). The purpose of the project was to practice component-based development in Vue.js while collaborating both within our own team and with another group. We gained experience in both designing and implementing a design created by others into a functional website.
The design was created in Figma by The Poison Dart Frogs, and we followed their guidelines for colors, typography, and layout during implementation.

This website is our first project using Vue.js and includes:
-	A landing section with information about poison dart frogs  
-	A contact page with a form  
-	An interactive game where players search for a hidden frog in the rainforest  

This project allowed us to explore Vue.js, Vue Router, and component-based development in practice. It was also a valuable learning experience to work from an existing design and translate it into code.


### üìñ The Story Behind the Name
As mentioned, the Poison Dart Frogs team ([Angelica Nylander](https://github.com/angien90), [Vy Petersson](https://github.com/tgvie), [Marie Lenvik](https://github.com/M-Lenvik) och [David Brunni](https://github.com/DavidBrunni)) created the design in Figma. Then, we ‚Äì the Meerkats ‚Äì took over both the design and the repo to bring it to life through code.
But when we inherited the Poison Dart Frogs‚Äô repo, an identity crisis hit us‚Äîwho were we now? That‚Äôs when the Meerkats transformed and became‚Ä¶ The Poison Meerkats! üéá
